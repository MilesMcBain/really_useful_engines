# Really Useful Engines

Talk given to Statistical Society of Australa - Victorian Branch 2022-07-21.

## Abstract

Really Useful Engines: Engineering Data Science

The modern Data Science team dreams of impact, or being declared "Really
Useful". The path to this goal is fraught with challenges, and in response we
have become increasingly dependent on workflows steeped in code, fortified by
Software Engineering principles. Slowly but surely it's become apparent to me
that this fortification is insufficient. Data Science has unique failure modes,
on which Software Engineering tools are mute. There remains plenty of scope for Data
Science teams to become mired in "Confusion and Delay". In this talk I build on
previous expositions of individual Data Scientist workflows in an attempt to distil
principles that can transform Data Science teams into Data Science engines.
